# What I Learned
Use of multiple scripts for one program.  
Ability to compartmentalise my code into functions and classes.  
Following some PEP8 guidelines to improve readability of my code.  
Tkinter functionality of: labels, buttons, radiobuttons, windows, entry boxes, output boxes, grid system.  
Integrated script I modified into the program.

# Future Goals
Add graphs for visual representation.  
Year by year movement.  
Calculate interest rates and years.  
Shift between light/dark theme.
